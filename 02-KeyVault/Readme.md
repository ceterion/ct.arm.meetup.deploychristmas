# 02 KeyVault Deployment
KeyVaults can be used to keep Secrets outside your Deployment Templates.
A KeyVault can store encrypted Keys, Credentials and Certificates.

The permission on these is granted to Azure AD Accounts. In a basic KeyVault Deployment, no Account (including the creator) is permitted to view it's contents.
